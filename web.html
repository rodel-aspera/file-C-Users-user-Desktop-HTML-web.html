    <h2 id="section-html">What is HTML?</h2>
    <p>
      <em class="html">HTML</em> stands for (Hypertext Markup Languange) and it
      uses text to describe the organizational structure of the material in an
      HTML file. The markup on a webpage instructs a web browser how to display
      text, pictures, and other types of multimedia.
    </p>
    <p>
      The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) has made HTML an official guideline,
      and most popular web browsers, including those for desktop and mobile
      devices, typically follow this proposal. The most recent version of the
      standard is HTML5.
    </p>
    <h2 id="section-css">What is CSS?</h2>
    <p>
      <em class="css">CSS</em> stands for (Cascading Style Sheets) and it is a
      language for stylesheets that is used to specify how a page presented in
      HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML). CSS
      specifies how items should be shown in various media, including speech,
      paper, screens, and other media.
    </p>
    <p>
      According to W3C guidelines, CSS is one of the fundamental languages of
      the open web and is standardized across Web browsers. In the past,
      different CSS standard components were developed simultaneously, allowing
      for the versioning of the most recent suggestions. Perhaps you are
      familiar with CSS1, CSS2.1, or perhaps CSS3. There will never be a CSS3 or
      CSS4, and instead, everything is CSS right now.
